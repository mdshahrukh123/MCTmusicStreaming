## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---

## Language Used
* Java

---
## Database Used
* Mysql WorkBench
---

## Data Model 
* User
* Admin
* Song
* Playlist
* AuthenticateToken
 --- 
## Entity 1
The User  model is defined in the User class, which has the following attributes:
```
userId : unique identifier for each user
Name : name of the User
Age :  age of all user
adderess : Address of the user
Email : email of user I used Validation ( @Email)
Password : I used validation ( @Pattern(regexp = "^.8/A-Z0-9/a-z/@_!") )

```

## Entity 2

The Song data model is defined in the Song class, which has the following attributes:
```
SongId : unique identifier for each Expense
Title : title of Expense 
description : description of the expense
Date :date of the Expense day

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name=""fk_user_id)
private User user

```
## Entity 3

The Authenticate Token  entity is defined in the Authentication Token class, which has the following attributes:
```
authId : unique identifier for each AuthenticationToken
TokenValue : Token of every Authenticated user (Automatic generated) 
DateAndTime :date And time of the token creation ( Automatic generated by LocalDateTime.now())

@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name=""fk_user_id)
private User user
```

## Data Flow

1. The User sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## Functions used :-

### API Endpoints :-
</br>
<b> user SignUp </b>

* PostMapping: "user/signUp"//"userSignIn"///"userSignOut"
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in UserService class which is connected to database. In database we add a new user given through API.
```

* GetMapping: /getAllUser
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in userService class which retrieves data of all job from database. This data is sent to controller which is then sent through the API to client.

```

* PostMapping: "playlist"
```
This endpoint post data of Expense by perticular user and save in database through API,
```

* PutMapping
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in expenseService class which is connected to Mysql database. In Mysql database we update a Descripton of Expense Price  by expenseId given through API.
```

* DeleteMapping
```
This endpoint makes a call to method in expenseService class which is connected to expenseRepository Class and this is connected to Mysql-database. In mysql-database we delete a expense by expenseId given through API.
```

---

## Data structure Used
* Mysql-DataBase (Persistence memory database)
```
We have used Mysql-DataBase data structure as a database to implement CRUD Operations 
```

## Project Summary

The  Music Streaming Api is a Spring Boot project written in Java that enables basic functionality for managing playlist of user. This project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which is a popular open-source framework for building production-ready applications. The project uses Mysql-DataBase as the data structure to store and manage  Playlist  data.

The project includes four main components, the userController, the userService, the userRepo, and the User class. The userController class receives requests from the User interface layer and delegates them to the userService. The userService processes the request and retrieves or updates data from the UserDao. The userDao uses an Mysql-DataBase data structure to store and manage Playlist song data, and the Playlist class defines the Playlist  data model.
